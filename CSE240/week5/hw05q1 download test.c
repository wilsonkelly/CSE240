// READ BEFORE YOU START:
// You are given a partially completed program that creates a list of students, like student's record.
// Each record has this information: student's name, id, department of the student, home country.
// The struct 'studentRecord' holds information of one student. Department is enum type.
// An array of structs called 'list' is made to hold the list of students.
// To begin, you should trace through the given code and understand how it works.
// Please read the instructions above each required function and follow the directions carefully.
// You should not modify any of the given code, the return types, or the parameters, you will risk of getting compilation error.
// You are not allowed to modify main ().
// You can use string library functions.

// WRITE COMMENTS FOR IMPORTANT STEPS IN YOUR CODE.

// NOTE: Notice how return type of add() is checked in case 'a' of executeAction()
// NOTE: You must convert the string 'department_input' to an enum type and store it in the list because the department has enum type (not string type).

// Q4:  load (10 points)
// This function is called in the beginning of main().
// This function reads the student list from the saved file and builds the array of structures 'list'.
// In the first run of the program, there will be no saved file because save() is called at the end of program.
// So at the begining of this function, write code to open the file and check if it exists. If file does not exist, then return from the function.
// (See expected output of add() in homework question file. It displays "Student_List.txt not found" because the file did not exist initially.)
// If the file exists, then parse the student list to read the student details from the file.
// Use the save function given above as an example of how to write this function. Notice the order in which the struct elements are saved in save()
// You need to use the same order to read the list back.
// NOTE: The saved file is not exactly readable because all elements of the struct are not string or char type.
//       So you need to implement load() similar to how save() is implemented. Only then the 'list' will be loaded correctly.
//		You can simply delete the file to 'reset the list' or to avoid loading from it.
